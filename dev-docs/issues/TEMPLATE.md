# NNN - Short descriptive title

**Type:** (conventional commit type: fix, feat, refactor, perf, docs, test, …)
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

<!--
Classify by user-facing impact, not by whether something was "broken".
`fix` and `feat` bump the release version (see [tool.semantic_release]
in pyproject.toml); reserve them for changes to the shipped package
(src/). A bug in a test, script, or CI workflow (bin/, tests/,
.github/) is still a bug, but it's not user-facing — classify it
`test` or `chore` instead so it doesn't spin the version. `docs` is for
documentation content, and never bumps the version either way.
